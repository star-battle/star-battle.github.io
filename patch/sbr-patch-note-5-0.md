# Star Battle Reloaded 5.0 - Patch Notes

> More features will be added in the future..

## Ships & Balance

- Queen reintroduced.

> Queen still requires more thought, not just testing. Abilities such as:
> - Symbiote 
> - Infestation
>
> Aren't considered to be complete - likely still flawed on both angles. But hopefully good enough to postpone
>
> Other avenues are "done" on the design aspect, but the exact way of implementation leaves a lot of room for improvements/changes.
>
> "Done" means I hope it's good enough for now, but I bet this is not a final iteration and I expect it might require a lot of revisions before things are in place.

### Queen

- Added missing blood FX when ship is crit/heavy/light damaged.
- Added first set of achievements for playing Queen ("Casual Play" category).
- Neural Parasite:
  - It's now a projectile driven ability - it needs time to arrive at the impact point.
  - Affected ships now require extra 2s for effect to complete, and fight for the Queen.
  - Affected ships can no longer use the shield.
    > This is mostly aimed at upgraded Carrier's interceptors
  - Duration increased from 20s to 25s.
  - Improved interactions with following units:
    - Interceptors can be box-selected.
    - Scourges will no longer suicide, instead they'll turn back, attacking nearest capital ship they'll see unfriendly.
    - Siege fighters & Broodlords will initially waypoint back to the other base.
    - Observer & spotter will initially follow the Queen.
    - Other units will initially a-move to the Queen.
- Infestation:
  - Can now be casted on non mechanical units - all zerg capital ships, including Queen itself.
  - Infestation cooldown ultimate 30s -> 45s
  - Fixed an issue where Queen's Infestation tentacle would remain floating in the space whenever it failed to connect with the target.
- Blinding Cloud:
  - It's now larger, and no longer a perfect circle, but an oval, that stretches to the sides in relation to the direction it was thrown.
  - It no longer limits the vision of the ships that are inside, but also blocks the line of sight of the approaching ships, similarly as Gas Clouds do.
  - [__TODO__] Add cast time
  - [__TODO__] Nerf radius
  - [__TODO__] Rotate 180
- Parasitic Bomb:
  - Reduced damage vs. Massive from 1350 to 1200
  - Removed target acquisition in response to the Parasitic Bomb damage, that would draw aggression to the Queen, from affected units and the ones which were nearby (in response to `CallForHelp`).
- Ensnare:
  - Upon impact effect stays on the battlefield for 1s before expiring (akin to Arbiter's storm), instead of one-time hit-scan like behavior.
- Fixed an issue where Blinding Cloud effect would persist, if player's ship was killed while cloud's effect was still active.
- Fixed an issue where Blinding Cloud wouldn't de-buff Overlord's Antennae.
- Fixed an issue where Infestation would not be immune to Dreadnought's Cover.
- Fixed an issue where Infestation wouldn't correctly mark player's ship as killed, by a result game couldn't be won until enemy base has been destroyed.
- Fixed an issue where Infested ship wouldn't have its minimap icon.

### Battlecruiser

- Fixed Lockdown to no longer disable ability to launch & retarget OBF and Escort Fighters (Carrier's Scouts).

### Dreadnought

- Fixed an issue where Cover could repeatedly attempting to redirect the same projectile. Combined with the slow down of speed for first ~0.5 second upon redirect, it could cause weird glitches, especially noticeable with chasing projectiles (i.e. Raven's Seeker, BC's Nuke).
- Fixed an issue where Cover would remain active when trapped in Arbiter's Stasis Field.

### Frigate

- Fixed range upgrade to actually increase launch/retarget of wraiths per 1.25 per level (instead of 1), as it was intended and written in the tooltip.
- Fixed inaccurate tooltip on Wraith upgrade mentioning increased damage by +0.5 to massive, where it was actually +1.

### VoidRay

- Remove phase shift scaling from shield upgrades-
- Remove damage reduction from armor.-
- Energy Nova:
  - Increase its damage to 125(+1275 vs massive)
  - Remove shield and energy leech.
  - Remove scaling from lasers.
  - Reduce nova radius to 4.
  - Increase nova animation (after changing blasts from 3 to 1) by 50%.
  - Nova does its full damage in 1 blast (instead of 3).
  - Revert nova energy cost to 100. Reset its cooldown to 10s.

### Misc balance

- Reduced AI leash radius (21 → 18) and movement limit (21 → 18) — units return to their post sooner when chased.
- Increased leash reset radius (5 → 7) — units re-anchor further from their origin before giving chase again.
- Increased call-for-help radius (2 → 4) and period (2 → 4) — nearby units now respond to allies under attack from further away, more often.
  > Above adjustments were made in response to the introduction of the Queen.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed lack of spacing between teams on the leader board.
- Fixed an issue where if match completed prematurely ("You won the game." message at the end - without any points), it would count as a loss for the victorious team.
- Fixed an issue where changed settings (UI config, ship skins etc.) wouldn't be immediately saved into bank file (it required completing rated game, or changing settings prior to picking a ship).
- Fixed an issue where `Team Side` option in lobby settings wouldn't apply. (Or rather, it was only being considered in games where teams were automatically balanced - so completely opposite from how it was intended).
- Fixed na issue where `Map` chosen in lobby settings wouldn't align with what the game actually used. 
  > The list presented in lobby was off by 1 element, so when you were picking `C`, the game was loading `B` etc. - in that order, with the exception of "Ulnar" - it was the only one that did align.
- Fixed a rare issue related to "Squads" - in some scenarios (reaching 15 players within the lobby at least once during its lifetime + some other edge case criteria) the game would fail to initialize completely - no bases, no ships.
- Fixed an issue where rating of the teams wasn't calculated in games that used `Premade / IH` mode, and had teams preset in lobby (no FFA). Resulting in `+16 / -16`. (It was working correctly only when teams were balanced automatically by in-game systems).
  > Really surprised we caught it just now. Also, please double check if it was indeed fixed, as it was kind of a blind fix.
